#### The first 3D printer was invented 34 years ago in 1983, by chuck hull He spent his spare time working on the invention. He now owns his own buissness called 3D systems. <https://www.3dsystems.com/>

#### 3D printing can be used to create prosthetics for individuals with missing limbs, organs, and facial parts. 3D printing has many bennefits, but the biggest is the cost. A normal prosthetic ranges from 5,000 to 50,000 and only lasts 3 -5 years due to wear and tear. Whereas a 3D printed prosthetic cost is in the hundreds and will last a lifetime.
