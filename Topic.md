#### 3D printing can be used to create prosthetics for individuals with missing limbs, organs, and facial parts. 3D printing has many bennefits, but the biggest is the cost. A normal prosthetic ranges from 5,000 to 50,000 and only lasts 3 -5 years due to wear and tear. Whereas a 3D printed prosthetic cost is in the hundreds and will last a lifetime. 3D printing prosthetics is especially beneficial for children because they are constantly growing and tend to outgrow their prosthetics. Whereas a 3D printed prosthetic is fitted to a child and is cost efficient.  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl8ijPGEKO8>
